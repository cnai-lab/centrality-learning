# Centrality Learning 

This repository is intended to contain tools and methods for learning arbitrary centrality measures for arbitrary graphs. 

Currently two methods are available: 
* [learned_routing_centrality](https://github.com/puzis/centrality-learning/tree/main/learned_routing_centrality) (original code by Liav Bachar can be found here: https://github.com/liavbach/LRC )
* [centrality_from_auralized_nodes](https://github.com/puzis/centrality-learning/tree/main/centrality_from_auralized_nodes)
